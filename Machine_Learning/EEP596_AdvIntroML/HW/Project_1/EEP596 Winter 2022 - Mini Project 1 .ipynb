    "In this mini-project - You will be working with real stock data pulled through the alpaca.markets api. We will provide you starter code below - So you can get started with using the API. You have about 2 weeks to work on this mini-project. Please get started early as identifying good strategies can take time. Good luck and have fun in the process!"

Your submission will include one submission of all the training code, back testing code, plots, requirements as outlined below + breakdown of contributions by each member of the project. Please make sure each member in your team tries out new trading strategies/algorithms and does coding as a way of contributing to the project. Also working in teams is a great way to brainstorm, collaborate and improve on your winning strategies."

    "### Question 1\n",
    "1. Pick any 5 tech stocks that have had a good performance year-over-year in the past year. You can look up NASDAQ tech stocks list or pick your favorites.\n",
    "1. Download the \"closing price\" and \"opening price\" data for each day of the 5 tech stocks over the past year using the ALPACA api (see below for starter code).\n",
    "1. Train at least 2 baselines (from the lecture - e.g. SMA, EMA) AND one or more ML based models (e.g. STL or supervised learning) on first 7 months of the data set\n",
    "1. Back-test your buy-sell strategy on the recent past 5 months for each of the 5 stocks you picked. Assume you are not doing day-trading - So you can't sell the stock the same day you bought them. Also assume that you are buying at closing time but can sell at opening or closing time. \n",
    "1. Implement your back-testing as an automatic trading mechanism (Algorithmic Trading) - I.e. buy when you have cash available if your algorithm says buy. And sell a bought stock if your algorithm says sell. Make sure, you have a profit margin of at least 0.5%\n",
    "1. Also implement your back-testing across the 5 stocks - I.e. buy/sell which ever stock is more appealing to your algorithm/trading strategy.\n",
    "1. Once you initiate the back-test - Your algorithm should be able to automatically buy and sell multiple times across the back-testing period (5 months). This is an example of Algorithmic trading - Where you don't have to initiate buy/sell order but the algorithm would do it for you. Avoid a buy-sell period that contains an Earnings day in it. E.g. GOOG has earnings day on Feb 1 - Avoid a buy before Feb 1 that gets sold after Feb 1. This is to not have your backtest be skewed by wind-falls or heavy losses at earnings.\n",
    "1. Use classes and modules to organize your training, back-testing, paper-trading and plotting code - See starter code for an example of methods to do paper-trading. \n",
    "1. Plot the time-series of the stocks over past 5 months and indicate using markers where your algorithm buys and sells\n",
    "1. What's the total profit of your strategies. Create a table with strategy and total profit and also percentage profit as your columns. Which is your best strategy ? \n",
    "1. What other evaluation metrics make sense for backtest?\n",
    "1. Also mention the insights/take-aways you gaind by working through this mini-project."

You can use the buy/sell order methods mentioned in starter code as an example to place orders for live paper trading. So your algorithm is automatically trading live but only on paper. Make sure, the settings for your algorithm enable you to buy and sell within the week (i.e. set your profit margin lower for sell). What's the profit you made?"
