    "- **(10 points) Subtask 2: Explain how Improved RNN resolves some of the problems in traditional RNNs from an optimization perspective.** Assume that the label decision function is one dimensional and is given by $f (X) = v^⊤ h_T$ . Let $L(X, y; θ) = L(f (X), y; θ)$ be the logistic loss function for the given labeled data point $(X, y)$ and with parameters $θ = (W, U, v)$. Then, check the gradients $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial U}$. A critical term in the expression of the gradients that determines whether it explodes/vanishes will be: $$M(U) = \\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} (αU^T D_{k+1} + βI)$$ where $D_k = diag(σ′ (Wx_k + Uh_{k−1} + b))$ is the Jacobian matrix of the pointwise nonlinearity. **Hint: Analyze the range of possible values for the condition number $\\kappa$ of the matrix $M(U)$**. \n"
