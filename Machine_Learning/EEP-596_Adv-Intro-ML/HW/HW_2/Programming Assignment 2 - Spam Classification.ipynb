    "## Spam Filtering\n",
    "In this programming assignment, we will be looking at Spam Filtering with a real data set that has a \"label\" for every email - i.e. spam or not spam. We will use logistic regression classifier to solve this assignment and participate in a friendly competition on Kaggle (Details below). The assignment goes from data loading to data inspection to data pre-processing to creating a train/test data set to finally doing machine learning, making predictions and evaluating it. This is typically one part of the \"full pipeline\" in ML modeling/prototyping - So you will get a sampler taste of some \"prototype pipeline\" work that happens in practice! Have fun!! And if you get stuck somewhere - Use discord - Maybe someone has a suggestion that will unblock you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission consists of two parts:\n",
    "a) A submission of your complete working code with train/validation data sets + your write-up with insights and your learnings (details on this provided below)\n",
    "b) Evaluation of your best model on the Kaggle evaluation data set - For this you can form a team of 2 - To brainstorm ideas and make your best submission. Include your team name, team members in your submission.\n",
